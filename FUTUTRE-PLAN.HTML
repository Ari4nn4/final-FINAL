  <p class="img">My plans have been decided as a young kid. I have always wanted to serve the country by being a part of the Navy.
    My grandfather participated in the Navy back in June 1989 right after his High School graduation, my uncle also participated in the Marines, and now my mother's cousin is in the Navy too, now that I'm Becoming older I decided to enlist as soon as I get out of Clovis High School.</p>
