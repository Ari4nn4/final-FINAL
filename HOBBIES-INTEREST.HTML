<p class="img">My friends and family always claimed that I have been around the trends or as others say "jack of all trades". Don't get them mistaken I have done a lot of things growing up such as
    skating, listening to music, and playing video games. I eventually attended sports to keep myself entertained. I participated in Clovis crossfire soccer, volleyball, cheer, and softball.
    My interests are highly in music. I currently own two instruments, a 6-string electric guitar, and a Four-string bass. Growing up I have always been fascinated by the famous video game Guitar Hero, which eventually became one of my interests.
     Music has always had a very big impact on my world, I was introduced to music by both of my parents. I take the time out of my day to attend anything that has to do with music. When it comes to music I'm not too picky. I enjoy various genres such as rock,k-pop, rap, and many more.
