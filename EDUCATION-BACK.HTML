<p>My whole life, I have only attended Clovis Unified District Schools. I have been through two  Elementary schools, Gettysburg Elementary through preschool and 2nd Grade and Jefferson Elementary, from 3rd grade to 6th grade.
    During my years in Elementary, I have done inside-school sports and outside. 
    I participated in soccer, softball, volleyball, football, cheer, and basketball. I have tried almost everything that elementary schools provided students to take action upon.
    I played a part of the Orchestra team through 5th- 6th grade and applied for Science club and Social Science clubs. 
    During middle school at Clark Intermediate, I did not experience it due to COVID-19, as it was very heartbreaking for me and others.
    Now I am currently in Clovis High School in the 11th grade, learning
    Advanced Push U.S History, Math 3, Advanced Push Psychology, and General Physics, also including my course throughout this year I have been picked out from Center Advanced for Research of Technology 
    to participate in Web App Development.</p>
