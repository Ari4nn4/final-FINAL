    <p class="img">My achievements in my life have mostly been just about sports. Dealing with school sports was the most entertaining moment of my life. When I was younger I  played soccer as a kid, I continued to push myself to be more involved with sports,  Which led me to get to the Valley championship with my team from 2017-2019.

        When I played different sports, I learned self-discipline, leadership, and resilience. I am glad to have pushed myself to be where I am now.</p>
